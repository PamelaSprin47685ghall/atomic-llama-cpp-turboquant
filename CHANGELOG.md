# Changelog

One section per release, keyed by the exact tag. `verify-version` refuses to cut
a release whose tag has no section here, so this gets written *before* the tag is
pushed — the release notes are generated from it verbatim.

Write it for the person who downloads the build: what they get, what changed for
them, what to watch out for. Not a commit dump — the notes already carry the full
commit list underneath.

Releases before `b10269-1.5.0` predate this file; see the git history.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **FlashPrefill V2 sparse prefill (experimental, opt-in, default off;
  implementation and compile delivered, runtime acceptance NOT RUN).**
  New `--flashprefill off|auto|required` policy plus tuning flags
  (`--flashprefill-alpha`, `--flashprefill-block-q`, `--flashprefill-block-k`,
  `--flashprefill-sink-blocks`, `--flashprefill-window-blocks`,
  `--flashprefill-dense-tail-tiles`, `--flashprefill-tail-scope`,
  `--flashprefill-min-kv`, `--flashprefill-full-attn-layers`,
  `--flashprefill-mean-correction`, `--flashprefill-exact-all`), backed by new
  GGML ops (`GGML_OP_FLASH_PREFILL_POOL/SELECT/ATTN`), CPU reference kernels,
  Vulkan native kernels, always-emitted `/metrics` series
  (`llamacpp:flashprefill_*`, zeros while OFF; GPU totals merged only after
  successful graph slices; GPU dispatch times 0 until the timestamp hook
  reports; required-mode enforcement is graph-side, metrics only counts),
  and `scripts/flashprefill-matrix.py` /
  `scripts/flashprefill-quality.py` harnesses. Only ordinary prefill and
  bounded RERoT teacher-forced injections are sparse-eligible (ordinary
  dispatch shared over supported KV shapes; raw-Q RERoT hooks Qwen3.5
  dense/MoE only, including current Ornith weights); decode, MTP
  draft/verify,
  embeddings, rerank, out-of-family RERoT, recurrent/SWA layers,
  transposed-V or multi-stream layouts, special KQ bias, and unsupported
  backends keep the existing dense path. TriAttention (`3/32`) semantics and the RERoT
  active-lane MTP pause are unchanged. See `PREFILL.md`.

### Notes

- **Acceptance not run.** The server, 4 new tests and 7 existing test
  targets all compile/link clean (`build-prefill/bin/llama-server`;
  baseline frozen separately), but no tests, benchmarks, quality gates, or
  deployment have been executed. No performance or quality claims are made;
  the Definition-of-Done checklist in `PREFILL.md` §21.3 remains fully
  unchecked. Hashes: see `build-prefill-evidence/manifest.json` and
  `binary-libraries.sha256`.
- State restores across contexts/processes/restarts are deliberately rejected
  (enabled-only 64-byte policy envelope; re-prefill on mismatch; no sidecar
  file). Qwen3.5 dense/MoE family only; other architectures get no automatic
  sparse routing.

## b10269-1.6.0

### Added

- **Windows AMD ROCm archive** `llama-turboquant-windows-x64-rocm.zip`. HIP
  backend for RDNA2 through RDNA4 and Ryzen AI 300 / Ryzen AI Max (gfx1030,
  gfx1100/1101/1102/1103, gfx1150/1151, gfx1200/1201), self-contained: the HIP
  runtime and the BLAS DLLs it links are bundled (about 100 MB), only a current
  Adrenalin driver is needed, no ROCm SDK install. Until now Windows + Radeon
  meant the Vulkan build; HIP is the faster prompt-processing path on these
  GPUs. Everything in the archive is Authenticode-signed, the AMD DLLs with
  AMD's signature where they ship one.
- **Linux ROCm archive** now also targets gfx950 (Instinct MI350/MI355X),
  gfx1150 (Ryzen AI 300) and gfx1103 (Radeon 780M/760M).
- `docs/amd/`: what ships for AMD, the ROCm vs Vulkan benchmark plan for the
  TurboQuant KV cache, and the open items. `scripts/bench-amd.sh` runs that
  matrix per backend build, `scripts/bench-amd-report.py` renders one table.

### Changed

- ROCm builds no longer pass `GGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN`; upstream removed the
  rocWMMA flash-attention path and the flag was a no-op.

### Notes

- **The Windows ROCm archive is beta.** It is built, signed and checked for
  completeness in CI, but has not been run on a Radeon yet. `llama-server
  --list-devices` must show a HIP device; if it does not, or if loading fails,
  report the GPU, driver version and the error, and use the Vulkan archive in
  the meantime.
- Atomic Chat does not select the Windows ROCm backend yet; the client change
  follows separately. Until then it is a manual download.

## b10269-1.5.1

### Fixed

- **Ling-3.0-flash (BailingMoeV3) no longer emits garbage token bursts.** The
  model is trained with clamped SwiGLU activations in its late layers, and the
  per-layer limits live in `config.json` under `expert_swiglu_limit_list` and
  `share_expert_swiglu_limit_list`. The public HF modeling code ignores those
  keys and so did this port, which caused deterministic transient logit
  collapse - output like `count += 1eville` dropped into otherwise fine
  generations. Measured at roughly -20 pass@1 on HumanEval (72.6% -> 93%+ with
  the fix); the garbage-token repro is eliminated.

### Notes

- **Re-convert your Ling-3.0-flash GGUF to get the fix.** The clamp limits are
  written by the converter into two new KVs (`{arch}.swiglu_clamp_exp` and
  `{arch}.swiglu_clamp_shexp`); a GGUF produced before this release does not
  carry them, and the runtime then defaults to no clamping. Re-download the
  quant or re-run `conversion/bailingmoe.py`.
- Both KVs are optional and default to zero, so existing GGUFs and every other
  architecture are unaffected. The graph needed no change - the SwiGLU clamp
  branches in `build_ffn` / `build_moe_ffn` already trigger on a nonzero
  per-layer limit, matching the vLLM `SwigluStepAndMul` semantics.

## b10269-1.5.0

### Added

- **NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10) support.** New archive
  `llama-turboquant-linux-arm64-cuda-13.3`, built natively for aarch64 with
  CUDA 13.3 and sm_121 SASS. Other arm64 NVIDIA machines (GH200, GB200, Jetson
  Thor) run it too, JITing the kernels from PTX on first launch. This is the
  first Linux arm64 build the fork ships — until now arm64 meant macOS only.
- **BailingMoeV3 (Ling 3.0) architecture support**, including the KDA gate
  handling.

### Changed

- **Linux CUDA archives are roughly half the size** — 1657 → 956 MB (12.4) and
  1879 → 1028 MB (13.3) measured across both the `.zip` and `.tar.gz`. The zips
  were storing `libcublas.so` → `.so.13` → `.so.13.5.1.27` as three full copies
  because `zip` followed the symlinks.
- **CUDA 13.3 builds ship Ampere PTX (`80-virtual`).** A100/H100/B200 were
  falling back to the Turing PTX floor, which silently disabled `cp.async` and
  the Ampere MMA path — both gated on `__CUDA_ARCH__ >= 800`. Those cards get
  Ampere-class kernels now. No architecture lost support in this release.
- Windows CUDA builds got their architecture lists pinned, all runner cores, a
  ccache that can actually hold a CUDA build, and 7-Zip instead of
  `Compress-Archive`. Release turnaround drops accordingly.

### Notes

- The DGX Spark archive has **not yet been validated on real GB10 hardware** —
  it is built and arch-checked in CI (`cuobjdump` asserts sm_121 SASS is
  present), but nobody has run it on a Spark yet. Treat this one as beta and
  report back.
- The CUDA 13.3 archives now use `-compress-mode=size`. Kernel SASS is
  unchanged and inference speed is unaffected; the fatbin is decompressed once
  at module load. It needs a driver from the CUDA 12.4 era or newer.
